# 🎯 - Considerations

> The project has a preview of a login and registration system, this system was all done with JS, as said before, only as a preview, it is necessary to adapt or remove it to use in your project because it was added since it was mandatory in the college project. The **Checkout WAS NOT** system was added for obvious reasons.

> Done at ♥️ by Henry8K and team.
